# FarmerAITool

The app we are going to build is going to help farmers to share their crops among them so that a specific criteria could be fulfilled. For example, if a farmer was ordered to yield a total of 12 tonnes of tomatoes in 90 days but due to his carelessness he lost 4 tonnes of tomatoes before 1 weak. Since he can't grow tomatoes in a weak his order will be cancelled. But if he had grown some other vegetables like carrots and he also have our app the scenario would be different. After he lost 4 tonnes of tomatoes but he still has carrots he can now exchange his carrots with 4 tonnes of tomatoes and he can gain the profit.


What our app does:
1) It will connect farmers from around that region.
2) Our app will find the closest farmers with whom one can exchange their crops.
